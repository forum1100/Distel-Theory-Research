# RT-BBN-001 — AlterBBN Successor Execution 2026-09-08

**Status:** executed computational successor test; not cosmology validation.

AlterBBN v2.2 was recovered from the historical archive, hashed, compiled from an untouched source copy, and executed on a separate build copy with GCC 16.2.0 / GNU Make 4.4.1.

Recovered AlterBBN archive SHA-256:
`46B94253CDE6AFCE15DDB9367FA454BAC91B25C9A1D3412CC19E512EC3515C17`

Stock failsafe=1 central output:
- Yp = 2.472892431214e-01
- D/H = 2.434823987112e-05
- He3/H = 1.031143037369e-05
- Li7/H = 5.466171494978e-10
- Li6/H = 1.072668319169e-14
- Be7/H = 5.179861834299e-10

The stock executable reported compatibility with its bundled BBN constraints with and without correlations. AlterBBN adds Be7 to Li7 post-BBN, so the printed Li7/H is the relevant final mass-7 quantity for this test.

## Local +10% sensitivity screen

Rate perturbations were applied one channel at a time in isolated source copies. Largest Li7/H responses were:
- R27, He3+He4 -> Be7: +9.7794%
- R17, Be7+n -> p+Li7: -6.2270%
- R60, Be7+He4 -> C11: +0.0885%
- R34, Be7+D -> p+2He4: -0.0861%

R19, R42, R49, and the R14 adjacent control each changed Li7/H by less than 0.07% in this screen.

This identifies R17 and R27 as the dominant tested local mass-7 levers. It does not establish that a 10% rate change is experimentally allowed.

## Preregistered relational triad

Before execution, three bounded mechanism probes were frozen:
- A: R17 x1.20
- B: R27 x0.80
- C: R34 x1.20

All singles, pairs, and A+B+C were then executed. Li7/H changes were A -11.5453%, B -20.2220%, C -0.1721%, AB -29.6204%, AC -11.6801%, BC -20.3595%, and ABC -29.7280%.

AB was 2.147 percentage points less suppressive than simple addition of isolated fractional effects; ABC was 2.211 points less suppressive than the isolated-effect sum. The tested combination was mildly sub-additive, not synergistically reinforcing.

## Successor decision

The strongest tested A+B+C case produced Li7/H = 3.841190679596e-10. Applying the historical 0.292 survival factor to the reproduced stock baseline would require approximately 1.596122076534e-10.

Therefore the tested modest local-rate mechanism does not reproduce the historical DT suppression target, and the relational combination did not reveal hidden amplification.

**Successor status:** `[LOCAL MASS-7 RATE-ADJUSTMENT MECHANISM WEAKENED]`.

This does not erase the historical DT-BBN branch and does not falsify every possible DT-BBN formulation. A surviving successor must independently derive a physical operator or justified reaction-rate change, preserve neighboring abundances, and survive external observational and nuclear-rate constraints.
